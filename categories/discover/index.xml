      <description>It was always amazing to watch Merrie Monarch. Besides hula, I can learn about Hawaiian mele (songs) and also the hula instruments. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Merrie Monarch for 3 years, and I&amp;rsquo;m still learning about the hula instruments that I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen. In Merrie Monarch 2019, there are two interesting instruments - ʻulili and ʻukēkē.
ʻulili I thought it was some kind of ʻuliʻuli while watching TV. But kumu Noe told us that it was ʻulili.</description>
