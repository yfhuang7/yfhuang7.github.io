Well, the title of this paper is "Partial Area Contributions to Storm Runoff in a Small New England Watershed" by Dunne and Black (1970), but Dunne used a lot of "water escaping" or "water escaped" in the article. It made me laugh every time I read water escape from where to where. I hope I can escape successfully, too!

Dunne and Black created an experiment for testing the theory of Horton overland flow and subsurface flow in their 60-acre backyard in Vermont. They would like to define the mechanisms of storm runoff production operating in a small watershed, and to see how much each forms of runoff contribute to the flow. With four different events: 1) Natural rainstorms, 2) Artificial storms of high return period on the steep, permeable trenches hillside, 3) Artificial storms on the channel areas, and 4) Artificial storms on the shallow soils of the seep B catchment, they indicated that the storm runoff is mainly controlled by rainfall intensity. Also, the storage and transmission within the soil contribute to the subsurface flow during the events.
