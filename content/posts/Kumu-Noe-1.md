Before the performance, kumu hula Noe told us:

*Hula is a package deal, you need to get your timing, follow the rhythm, make sure the right gesture, and be grateful and strong at the same time. Also, you need to show your personality! If you just dance the dance, it's not hula, student.*

I've been dancing hula in UH with kumu Noe for two years. Kumu is strict at the same time she try her best to respect her student, other halau, and other culture. I like her always insisting something about hula. She has her boundary of her hula. How about me? What is my boundary of what I love?
