Dinner time today with some Japanese friends:

During the dinner time, someone was doing something dangerous, so my friend told me that "Abunai" is dangerous in Japanese. Later on, one of my friends brought very yummy food, I said *"ちょっと危ない  (Chotto Abunai means a little dangerous)"*, dangerous in the way that I tend to eat too much...

Then I thought of "piri karai (means a little spicy)", I changed the saying to *"piri abunai!"*. It turned out that Japanese usually only use "piri" to describe spicy food. But one of my friend told me that in there area, they use "piri piri" to describe light rain! It probably comes from Kyoto area.

Now it's "piri piri" in Manoa valley, and I like it. What else can we use "piri" to describe?
