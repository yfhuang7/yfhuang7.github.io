Douinot et al. (2016) indicate that the FFG method significantly overestimates the intensity necessary to exceed the threshold flow for high intensity events in three catchments in France. They show the importance of the rainfall spatial variability in the estimating the rainfall intensity threshold for the flash flood forecasting. They proposed a Spatialized FFG (SFFG), a modified FFG with considering rainfall spatial characteristics. It has better estimations than the FFG in the high rainfall intensity cases. Besides, it offers the potential to analyze the sensitivity of the hydrological response to the spatial characteristics of the precipitation events as a function of the forecast lead time.  Yet, it does not consider factors other than the spatial distribution of rainfall, for instance, soil properties.
