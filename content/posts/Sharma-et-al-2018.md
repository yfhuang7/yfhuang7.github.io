I appreciate all the efforts that has been done for the previous research. Some papers provide us knowledge; some papers correct our imagination of the world; some papers gave a clear picture of how the world processing, and some papers inspire and encourage us. Ashish's paper is one of the inspiration, at least to me.

I met Dr. Ashish Sharma in the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society conference this year. I accidently went to his talk, and was impressed by how clear he explain a concept. Also I accidently presented my peakflow research in the same panel as him (he was the invited speaker for our panel). He presented Wasko's paper (2017) that time, it was very interesting. Although I follow up after the conference in few weeks, yet too much other work buried me till now while I'm doing literature review for my Ph.D. dissertation proposal and the peakflow manuscript.

Too much intro, let's take a look what's inside the paper by Sharma et al. (2018):

First, they gave very nice and clear literature review with one or two sentence summary for each paper on how extreme precipitation has been changed over time, and how extreme streamflow didn't change in the same ways. They pointed out the gap of our understanding and knowledge between rainfall and peakflow.

Second, they destructed the mechanisms of flood to approach their question "Why aren't floods?" with a lot of literature supported. Besides, they expected some changes.

Third, they recommend more efforts on understanding the relationship between extreme rainfall and streamflow, including *1) changes to antecedent hydrologic conditions and their impact on flood response; 2) changes in the proportion and persistence of storms arising from different causative mechanisms, such as an increased proportion and frequency of convective extremes; 3) Interaction among catchment size and geometry and changing storm characteristics including extent, intensity, and duration; 4) snow-cover and snow volume changes and their changing contributions to flood extremes in a warmer climate; 5) the role of land cover change (especially, but not only, urbanization) and the interaction of land cover change with climatic factor.*

I was inspired because I kept comparing my peakflow research to the context, kept asking why this and why that, and noticed the differences between us. Yet, some factors are definitely worthy to look into.
