Why do we need a staff plate?

*We need staff plate for knowing the stage (water height) while we're measuring streamflow to build rating curve - a relationship between discharge and stage that allows us to know discharge by only stage.*

Why do we need to have a staff plate if we have other continuous stage sensors (i.e. pressure transducer) already?

*A staff plate is a datum that it won't shift, so it's a solid reference for the streamflow. Also, it helps us to certain our measurement while we need to switch or renew the sensor.*


So... How to build a staff plate? Below is my experience in Hawaii, it might need to be adjusted in other places.

Let's see what we need first! We will need (The original list is from Dr. Ayron Strauch, a hydrologist in CWRM):
* [3/8 inch diameter anchor bolts in 3.5 and 4.5 inch lengths](https://amzn.to/2UtJMRm)
* [3/8 inch washers and spacers](https://amzn.to/2E8JQ36)
* A variety of metal [90 degree brackets](https://amzn.to/2L47DCR) used for framing houses. Note that the holes have to be bigger than the anchor bolts (3/8')
* [A hammer drill](https://amzn.to/2ElDVIQ) and 3/8 inch diameter [carbide-tiped drill bit](https://amzn.to/2Qnl4n0) plus at least a few small [metal/wood bits (1/8th and 1/4 inch)](https://amzn.to/2Eb0Ju8)
* [A bottle of quickcrete premixed concrete](https://amzn.to/2PsfQ40)
* 2x6 inch trex plastic wood (please check your local lumber)
* [Self-drilling screws](https://amzn.to/2Eb9lAE) to anchor the staff plate to the plastic wood
* Other tools: A hammer, a level, a screw driver (or bit)...
* Of course, a [staff plate]http://www.benmeadows.com/ben-meadows-fiberglass-stream-and-staff-gauges_36816387/
