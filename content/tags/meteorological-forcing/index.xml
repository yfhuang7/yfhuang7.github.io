      <description>As a hydrological modeler, meteorological forcing is always crucial and challenging. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve heard re-analysis for a quite long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really tried to understand it till now. All I knew was that reanalysis is combining observation and model to produce gridded, 3-dimensional atmospheric data.
I found a BAMS essay by Wendy S. Parker (September 2016): REANALYSES AND OBSERVATIONS - What&amp;rsquo;s the Difference?. My idea of reanalysis wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far, yet I was surprised that the re-analysis is not too different from observation except that we have less understanding of accuracy and uncertainty in re-analysis than observation.</description>
