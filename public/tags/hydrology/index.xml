      <title>Next Generation Water Resources Model</title>

      <description>In previous and current NWM, they showed heterogeneous results across the US. It implied that WRF-Hydro or a single hydrological model is insufficient to represent the local processes. Therefore, a framework that allows multiple models is needed. NextGen Water Resources Model is not an “A” model, but a framework to link different models. The NOAA-OWP expects it to be a “plugin-and-play” framework. To approach the goal, the major challenge is how to plug-in and link models together.</description>

      <description>Once a while, hydrologist gathered and discussed what the important hydrology questions that are not solved yet. Recently, Blöschl et al. (2019) spent more than a year to survey and conclude 23 unsolved hydrology problems. I really appreciate their work - it&amp;rsquo;s always to know where we are, what the status is, and what our goals are in the community. The problems have been classified into 6 groups - &amp;ldquo;The variability and change&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Space variability and scaling&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Variability of extreme&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Interfaces in hydrology&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Measurements and data&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Modeling methods&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Interfaces with society&amp;rdquo;.</description>
