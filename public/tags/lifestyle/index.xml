      <description>There were a lot of cardboard boxes on the ground with his stocks inside when I visited my friend&amp;rsquo;s place. I asked him &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t you feel inconvenient walking around?&amp;rdquo; He said yes, but he got used to it and didn&amp;rsquo;t know what he can do for his stocks.
I asked him &amp;ldquo;do you want to buy a shelf?&amp;rdquo; He said he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend money on the shelf and there is no elevator in his place.</description>
