      <description>PI: Dr. Yinphan Tsang
This project proposes to strategically characterize the natural flow regime of forest watersheds, the water resources protected by Hawai&amp;rsquo;i natural forests. This project proposes to support and train students and research assistants to perform various hydrological analyses to understand and reconstruct the natural flow regime of forested watersheds. The objectives of this study include:
 Examine types of forest watersheds and their typical streamflow response to precipitation, and describe their natural flow regime When data available, perform hydrologic analyses and/or modeling to address or simulate stream flow dynamics of the forest watersheds  This project will gather preliminary data and ultimately applying to large federal agency proposals.</description>
